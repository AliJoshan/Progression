# Progression

**Progression** is a minimal personal dashboard for tracking tasks, goals, and consistency over time.  
It is built for people who care about actual progress, not motivation, gamification, or dopamine-driven productivity.

- No streak fireworks.  
- No badges.  
- Just honest visibility into what you did — and whether you’re moving forward.

## Why Progression Exists

Most productivity tools optimize for engagement, not truth.  
They keep users busy, motivated, and entertained — but often fail to answer a simple question:

**Am I actually making progress?**

Progression exists to solve that problem by:

- Making progress visible  
- Emphasizing consistency over intensity  
- Treating data as feedback, not judgment  

---

## Core Philosophy

- **Progress over motivation**  
- **Consistency over intensity**  
- **Visibility creates accountability**  
- **Small daily actions compound**  
- **Data over emotions**

> Progression is not designed to excite you — it’s designed to tell you the truth.

## What You Can Do

- Create and manage goals  
- Attach daily tasks to each goal  
- Track task completion history  
- View weekly and monthly progress  
- Monitor consistency through a clean dashboard  
- Review progress without noise or distractions  

---

## What Progression Is Not

- Not a dopamine-driven productivity app  
- Not a habit “game”  
- Not a shortcut to success  
- Not a replacement for discipline  

> Progression doesn’t push you. It shows you where you stand.
