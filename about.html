                A minimal tool for tracking what matters. No noise. No gamification.
                Just clarity on whether you're moving forward.

            <h2>What Progression Is</h2>
            <p>
                Progression is a personal dashboard for tracking daily tasks, goals,
                consistency, and long-term progress. It provides a clear view of your
                efforts over time — emphasizing discipline and visibility rather than
                motivation or instant gratification.

            <h2>The Problem It Solves</h2>
            <p>
                Many people stay busy without knowing if they are truly progressing.
                Days blur together, efforts feel scattered, and there's no honest
                record of what was actually accomplished. Progression exists to make
                progress measurable, honest, and visible over time.
